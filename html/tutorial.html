    <h2>html, css, JS 3대장 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>What I assume about these three factors are to achieve my dream goal which allows me to enjoy creating something and also improve someone's difficulty with this PC technology.</p>
<p>Not only stopping here, I want to retake my life under control. That's the motivation to put all my passion and effort to live as the web developer for now.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal would be to become backend developer because I found most data engineer or similar task role is acceptable with some programming experience.</p>
<p>Backend developer experience would be somewhat convenient to adapt into the data analyst world.</p>
<p>Yet, I do not regret about my decision. I have always imagined to handle the computer well with joy</p>

<p>However, I have to aware that I have a far behind competitive ability compare to my senior school friend who took CS degree whilst he was at uni</p>
<p>I do not regret about what I have earned the economics degree in Australia. It allowed me to start learning this web developing area with less hesitation.</p>
<p>I will have to apply for the web developer's job at least in 2021. Hopefully start my web developer career at mid of its year.</p>

<p>To do so, I have to work real hard and save my other time to absorb and meet the real world industry's demand.</p>

<h3>short-term objective</h3>

  <li>Edit my tistory blog</li>
  <li>Keep updating this webpage. This could be a great diary record to check what I can do. Perhaps as my portfolio</li>
