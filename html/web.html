    <h2>Web이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
      system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform
      Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
      interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The
      resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
      (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web
      browser and are published by a software application called a web server.
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed
      the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the
      Web is built.
